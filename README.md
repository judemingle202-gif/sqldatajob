# üëã Introduction
This project analyzes the German data job market to uncover the roles and skills that matter most. üíº
I explored top paying jobs üí∞, top paying skills üõ†, and in-demand skills üìà to see what employers value.
The analysis also ranks skill-based salaries üíµ and highlights the optimal skills üéØ that balance demand with high pay.
These insights provide a clear picture of where opportunities lie for data professionals. üöÄ
As an aspiring data analyst in Germany, this serves as both a guide and a roadmap for my career path. üåü
üìÇ You can explore the full analysis and code in this folder üëâ [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)

# üèó Background
The motivation for this project came from my goal of understanding the German data job market as I prepare for a career as a data analyst. To guide the analysis, I focused on answering key questions:
	‚Ä¢	üíº What are the top paying jobs in Germany‚Äôs data field?
	‚Ä¢	üõ† Which skills pay the most and are most valuable to employers?
	‚Ä¢	üìà What are the most in-demand skills across job postings?
	‚Ä¢	üíµ How do individual skills rank by salary potential?
	‚Ä¢	üéØ Which optimal skills combine high demand with high salary?

This project was inspired by practice problems and analysis techniques from Luke Barousse‚Äôs YouTube channel, which provided a strong foundation for framing the questions and structuring the SQL analysis. You can check out his content here: [SQL Course](https://youtu.be/7mz73uXD9DA?si=MjlvkhgqwHjL0M_o)
# üõ† Tools Used
To carry out this analysis, I worked with a range of tools that supported data exploration, query execution, and project management:

	‚Ä¢	üóÑ SQL ‚Äì for querying and analyzing job posting data

	‚Ä¢	üêò PostgreSQL ‚Äì as the database system to store and manage the dataset

	‚Ä¢	üíª Visual Studio Code ‚Äì for writing, testing, and organizing SQL scripts

	‚Ä¢	üåø Git ‚Äì for version control and tracking project progress

	‚Ä¢	üêô GitHub ‚Äì for hosting and sharing the project repository

# üìä The Analysis
To understand the dynamics of the data job market in Germany, I conducted a structured analysis focusing on both quantitative and qualitative aspects. The goal was to identify top paying jobs,top paying job skills,skills in high demand, top skill based on salary and  the most optimal skill. Below is how I uncovered patterns in job postings focusing in Germany by exploring different categories :

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
**Question**: What are the top-paying data analyst jobs in Germany?

**How?** By filtering out postings without salary data, the analysis identifies the top 10 highest-paying data-related roles in Germany.

**Why?** This analysis sheds light on the most lucrative opportunities for data professionals, helping candidates understand where advanced skills and leadership responsibilities translate into higher pay.

In order to find this results I entered the query below:

```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date::DATE,
    company_dim.name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id    
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location LIKE '%Germany%' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Results:**

# üìö What I learned
Working through this SQL project from Luke Barousse‚Äôs YouTube course
 gave me both technical and practical experience:

- üõ† **SQL Skill Growth:** I built confidence moving from basic queries **(SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY)** to more advanced techniques **(JOINs, CTEs, subqueries, and aggregations)**. This helped me structure my code to answer real-world data problems step by step.

- ‚ùì **Asking the Right Questions:** The project trained me to frame queries around business-relevant questions like ‚ÄúWhat are the top-paying jobs?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhich skills are most in-demand?‚Äù ‚Äî an essential skill for turning raw data into insights.

- üåç **Industry Insights (Germany Focus):** By filtering the dataset for Germany, I gained valuable perspective on the data analyst job market, identifying which skills are both high-paying and high-demand. This is especially important to me as I aim to pursue a data analyst career in Germany in the future.

# üèÅ Conclusions

This project provided a comprehensive look at the data analyst job market in Germany and gave me the chance to apply SQL to real-world, career-relevant questions.

- üí∞ Top-Paying Jobs: Revealed that specialized research and leadership roles dominate the high end of salaries, showing the value of both technical depth and leadership experience.

- üîë Top-Paying Skills: Highlighted how cloud platforms (BigQuery, Redshift, GCP) and big data tools (Spark, Kafka, Databricks) can significantly boost earning potential.

- üìà Most In-Demand Skills: Demonstrated the consistent demand for SQL, Python, Tableau, Excel, and Power BI, proving that strong fundamentals are still the backbone of data analysis.

- ‚öñÔ∏è Optimal Skills (Salary + Demand): Showed that blending high-demand tools (SQL, Python) with premium niche skills (Spark, BigQuery, GCP) creates the best path for career growth.

üîé For me, this analysis was especially relevant because it not only strengthened my SQL querying skills but also gave me direct insights into the German data job market, where I aspire to build my career as a data analyst.

üëâ For any aspiring data analyst, the key takeaway is clear:

- Master the fundamentals (SQL, Python, BI tools).

- Invest in cloud & big data technologies.

- Stay curious and keep asking the right questions.

This blend of skills and curiosity will open doors to opportunities in the growing field of data analytics.
