/*-- Analysis:
--Engineering Pays the Premium: The highest salaries (around â‚¬166k) are 
commanded by specialized Data Engineering, DevOps, and Cloud Infrastructure 
skills like Kafka, Terraform, BigQuery, and Redshift.

--Cloud Competence is a Differentiator: Expertise in major cloud platforms and 
their tools (e.g., GCP, BigQuery) drives a significant salary bump, separating 
high-earning analysts who can manage infrastructure from those who only analyze data.

-- Core Skills are Foundation, Not Top Salary Drivers: While foundational skills like SQL,
 Python, and Power BI are essential to getting hired (they are the most demanded), they 
 appear further down the high-salary list.
